# Caked
A birthday-themed Space Invaders-like game

I decided to make this game and release it for free to celebrate my birthday (After all, giving gifts can be just as fun as receiving them!). That was a long time ago, so I decided to clean up the code and re-release the game with a few improvements. You can play the game [here](https://jacic.itch.io/caked), or build it yourself. The game is open source, and I'm hoping this will allow others who are interested in game development to learn from this game.

The Haxe source code and all the assets are included. You'll need [Haxe](https://www.haxe.org), [OpenFL](https://www.openfl.org), and [HaxePunk](https://www.haxepunk.com) to build.
